## Bubblesort

A sorting method that compares values down the list and swaps until sorted.

*bubblesort(): O(n^2)*

## Insertion Sort

A sorting method that pushes each value into its correct place as checks each val.

*insertionsort(): O(n^2)*

## Merge Sort

A sorting method that recursively sorts a list by dividing it into sublists and then sorting those.

*mergesort(): O(n * log(n))*

## Quick Sort

A sorting method that recursively sorts a list.

*quicksort(): O(n * log(n)) Average - O(n^2) Worst*

## Radix Sort

A sorting method that sorts numbers based on the values of their segnificant digits.

*radixsort(): O(n * k)*
